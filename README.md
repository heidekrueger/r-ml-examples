# r-ml-examples
This repository contains some ML examples and tutorials written in R that I built as a TA for TUM's Business Analytics and Machine Learning class.


* `q_learning_gridworld` includes an R implementation of Q-learning (i.e. off-policy TD control) in a classical Grid World problem.
* `gradient_descent` contains R visualisations of basic gradient descent with several step-size rules in a simple convex 2d setting.
* `neural_network` contains a simple implementation of feed-forward NNs (forward pass + backprop from scratch (no autograd)), as well as visualizations in a simple 2d setting that demonstrate the capacity trade-offs when designing NNs.
